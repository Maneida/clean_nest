call-to-action for users to sign up or order services.

Allow users to select the type of service they need, choose a date and time, 
and provide any additional details.

## Account Creation/Login Page: 
Allow users to create a new account or log in to an existing account.

Once logged in, users should have access to a dashboard where they can manage 
their bookings, view past orders, and update their account information.

## Contact Page: 
Provide contact information for the cleaning company, including a contact form 
for inquiries.
