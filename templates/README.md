# CLEANING COMPANY PAGES

For a cleaning company website/web app where users can create an account and 
order cleaning services, you would typically need the following pages:

## Home Page: 
Introduce the cleaning company, highlight services, and provide a 
call-to-action for users to sign up or order services.

## Services Page: 
Detail the types of cleaning services offered, including descriptions, pricing,
and any special offers.

## Booking Page: 
Allow users to select the type of service they need, choose a date and time, 
and provide any additional details.

## Account Creation/Login Page: 
Allow users to create a new account or log in to an existing account.

## User Dashboard: 
Once logged in, users should have access to a dashboard where they can manage 
their bookings, view past orders, and update their account information.

## Contact Page: 
Provide contact information for the cleaning company, including a contact form 
for inquiries.

## About Us Page: 
Share information about the cleaning company, its mission, values, and team 
members.

## FAQ Page: 
Address frequently asked questions about the cleaning services, booking process, 
pricing, etc.

## Terms and Conditions/Privacy Policy Page: 
Outline the terms of service and privacy policy for using the website/web app.

## Blog/News Page (Optional): 
Share cleaning tips, company news, or other relevant content to engage users.

Additionally, you may want to include pages for special promotions, customer 
testimonials, and a gallery showcasing before-and-after photos of cleaned spaces.
